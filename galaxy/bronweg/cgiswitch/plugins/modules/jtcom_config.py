module: jtcom_config
short_description: Configure JTCom CGI Ethernet switches
description:
  - Idempotent configuration of VLANs and ports on JTCom-compatible L2 switches.
  - Wraps napalm-jtcom C(apply_device_config()) for deterministic, diff-aware apply.
  - Supports Ansible check mode (dry-run) natively.
  - Ports are 1-based everywhere.
  - VLAN membership input uses canonical on-wire semantics: C(untagged) means
    the VLAN sent untagged on wire, and C(tagged) means VLANs sent tagged on wire.
options:
  host:
    description: IP address or hostname of the switch.

  backup_before_change:
    description: Download and save a config backup before applying any real change.
    type: bool
    default: true
  allow_port_mode_change:
    description: >
      Allow VLAN membership changes that would move a port between effective
      access and trunk mode. Blocked by default.
    type: bool
    default: false
  allow_untagged_move:
    description: >
      Allow destructive untagged/native VLAN moves. By default, changing a port
      from one untagged/native VLAN to another fails in apply mode.
    type: bool
    default: false
  allow_vlan_delete_in_use:
    description: >
      Allow deleting VLANs still referenced by ports by auto-detaching those
      ports first. This is a destructive override.
    type: bool
    default: false
  vlans:
    description: >
      Incremental VLAN changes, keyed by VLAN ID (string or int).
      VLAN-centric membership fields are expressed in canonical on-wire terms
      and may contain C(tagged_ports), C(untagged_ports), C(tagged_add),
      C(tagged_remove), C(tagged_set), C(untagged_add), C(untagged_remove),
      C(untagged_set), C(name), and C(state).
      Ports are 1-based IDs. Omitting C(state) defaults to C(present).
      VLANs not listed are untouched. VLAN 1 cannot be deleted.
    type: dict
  ports:
    description: >
      Incremental port changes, keyed by 1-based port ID (string or int).
      Each entry may contain C(admin_up) (bool), C(speed) (str),
      C(flow_control) (bool), and optional VLAN membership shortcuts:
      C(access_vlan), C(native_vlan), C(trunk_add_vlans), C(trunk_remove_vlans),
      and C(trunk_set_vlans). Port-centric VLAN input is translated to the same
      canonical membership planner used for VLAN-centric syntax.
      C(access_vlan) configures a canonical untagged access port.
      C(native_vlan) + C(trunk_*) configures a canonical trunk.
      Set C(admin_up: false) to administratively disable a port.
      Ports not listed are untouched. Port 6 (management uplink) cannot be
      administratively disabled.
    type: dict
notes:
  - "Run this module on the Ansible controller (C(connection: local))."
  - napalm-jtcom must be installed in the Python environment used by Ansible.
  - Use C(--check) for a safe dry-run that shows planned changes without applying them.
  - Untagged/native VLAN moves are blocked by default.
  - VLAN delete-in-use is blocked by default.
  - Access/trunk mode changes are blocked by default.
  - If a changed port would otherwise have no VLAN membership, it is mapped to
    access VLAN 1 and a structured warning is returned.

  - napalm-jtcom >= 0.8.0
